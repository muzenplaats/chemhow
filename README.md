# chemhow v0.1.0-delta (draft)
This is currently a symbolic test for chemical elements, atoms, molecules,
compounds, reactions and others.

## Symbolic test
**Hydrogen atom and molecule**
```chemhow
H
H-.
H_2
                          H + H <=> H_2,                             [1]
                        H-. + .-H <=> H_2,                          [1a]
                        H^+ + -^H <=> H_2,                          [1b]
```
in which equation [1] is a covalent reaction,
equation [1a] the radical-radical interaction and [1b] the ionic interaction.

**The isotopes of hydrogen**
```chemhow
1^H_2 === H_2
1^H 2^H === HD
2^H 1^H === DH
2^H_2 === D_2
1^H 3^H === HT
3^H 1^H === TH
2^H 3^H === DT
3^H 2^H === TD
3^H_2 === T_3
```

**The periodic table**
```chemhow
He
Li, Li-., Li^+,
Be, Be-., Be^{2+},
B, C, N, O, F, Ne,
...
```

**Organic chemistry**
```chemhow
CH_4, CH_3, CH_3-.,
...
                     CH_3 + OH <=> CH_3OH,                           [2]
                   CH_3-. + .-OH <=> CH_3OH,                        [2a]
                   CH_3^+ + -^OH <=> CH_3OH.                        [2b]
```
The equations [1] and [2] are the entries for the fuel cells.

**Carbon fixation**
```
                     CO_2 + CaO -> CaCO_3,                           [3]
```
in which `CO_2` === `O=C=O` === `::O=C=O::`.

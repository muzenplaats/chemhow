# Isotope effects

## Hydrogen (H), deuterium (D) and tritium (T)

The isotope effects of the hydrogen molecule.
```chemhow
H + H -> H_2       [1-1]
H + D -> HD
D + H -> DH
H + T -> HT
T + H -> TH
D + D -> D_2
D + T -> DT
T + D -> TD
T + T -> T_2       [1-9]
```

The isotope effects of hydrocarbons.
```chemhow
{12}_C + H -> {12}_CH   [2a-1]
{12}_C + D -> {12}_CD   [2a-2]
{12}_C + T -> {12}_CT   [2a-3]
{13}_C + H -> {13}_CH   [2b-1]
{13}_C + D -> {13}_CD   [2b-2]
{13}_C + T -> {13}_CT   [2b-3]
...
{12}_C + H_4 -> {12}_CH_4  [2]
...
```
